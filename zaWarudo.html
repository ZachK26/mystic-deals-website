        Meganium is a quadrupedal, pale-green Pok√©mon that resembles a sauropod
        dinosaur. It has a long neck; yellow eyes; a short, blunt snout; and two
        stamen-like antennae on top of its snout. The antennae are shorter on a
        female than on a male. Encircling Meganium's neck are large, pink flower
        petals with a yellow central pattern and white edges. It has three claws
        on each foot and a stubby tail. Meganium's petals release an aroma that
        calms aggressive feelings and its breath has the power to revive dead
        grass and plants. Its soothing, regenerative powers can even affect
        those who stand nearby. Meganium tends to be very docile and has been
        portrayed as a peacemaker in the anime. It can rarely be found living in
        grasslands.
